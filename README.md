# EDA_Stackoverflow_Survey
1) Analysed responses from the Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2020.
2) Some of the interesting inferences drawn from the survey are-
1. Most programmers hold a college degree, although a fairly large percentage did not have computer science as their major in college, so a computer science degree isn't compulsory for learning to code or building a career in programming.
2. Javascript & HTML/CSS are the most used programming languages in 2020, closely followed by SQL & Python
3. One can learn and start programming professionally at any age, and you're likely to have a long and fulfilling career if you also enjoy programming as a hobby.
