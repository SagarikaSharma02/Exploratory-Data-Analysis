1) Analyzing responses from the Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2020.

Javascript & HTML/CSS are the most used programming languages in 2020, closely followed by SQL & Python
Python is the language most people are interested in learning - since it is an easy-to-learn general purpose programming language well suited for a variety of domains
One can learn and start programming professionally at any age, and you're likely to have a long and fulfilling career if you also enjoy programming as a hobby.
